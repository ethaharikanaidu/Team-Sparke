Block
A collection of statements that can be grouped together to be treated as one statement. For instance in C
and Processing statements inside parentheses are treated as one statement that is either executed together or
not. Generally the only \entry" into a block of code is at the top of the code.

Cache
Is memory used to call speed memory access, that stores data that is anticipated to be used next or was just
used and may be used again. For example: cache may exist on slow physically rotating discs to save information
of data that is near to the data just accessed or  to hold data without writing it to disc until it is likely not to
change again.
